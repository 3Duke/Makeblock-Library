Makeblock_Lib
=============

Library for Makeblock electronic modules

This library is for replacing the Me_Lib_V2.0, the library is rebuild and improved, we recommand Makeblock customers using this library to replace the old one.

How to use:

Download files from Github, you will get the folder which includes:Makeblock.h,Makeblock.cpp and other folds named with Me_xx.change the folder name to "Makeblock" if it is not this name. Copy this folder to your Arduino Library path, the library path is similar as follows(maybe some slient different because of different version name):

xxx\arduino-1.0.3-windows\arduino-1.0.3\libraries
